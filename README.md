# About RITA- the AI bartender
Ironhack's Data Analytics Bootcamp Final Project

## Overview
For my final project in the Data Analytics Bootcamp my ultimate goal was to use AI to create something fun!
Therefore I decided to create a virtual bartender that accepts your inputs in the form of an ingredient or a specific cocktail name and generates instant recipes for you to try. 
That's how RITA was born. Imagined to be used by professionals or by friends who don't want to lose too much time thinking about what cocktails to make.

## The making-of RITA
- Train GPT-3 with cocktail recipes
- Create database using SQLite
- Set up py file
- Create an app with Flask
- Make the app visual appealing using HTML and CSS

## Getting started
It is essential to have an OpenAI key. 
After that all you have to do is insert the key in the py file and run it.
